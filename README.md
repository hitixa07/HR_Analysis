# HR_Analysis_Atliq_Hardwere
HR manager provides us data of attendance of 3 months of 2022 in the form of Excel sheets and she wants some insights from this data. Now, as a data analyst, it is most important for me to listen and try to understand the requirements. 
HR manager requirements are as follows:
1. The working preference of people between WFH and WFO?
2. The percentage of Sick leave to monitor employee wellness?
3. How much percent of people are present on a given week or a month?
4. Which day in a week when most of the people are present so that they can plan an event on that day?
5. The pattern of sick leave so if there is a situation of epidemic or flu, they can do proper precaution or special measure.

So, In order to achieve that requirements I follow some steps:

1. Data Cleaning and Data Transformation using power query editor: Combine the data from multiple sheets that has different column names, Transform all the dates in different columns to one column,
Created custom columns etc.
2. Build KPI's: I used to build key performance indicators like Presence %, WFH %, SL % using different formulas.
3. Formulas used: During the process of creating measures I frequently used Switch, Divide, Calculate, Sum formulas.
4. Charts: I have used area chart and trend line to show the insights clearly.

Key Insights Drawn:
1. Presence % by month is declining so, It may be due to summer season.
2. WFH % of working people is increasing.
3. SL % is little bit increasing.
4. Most of the employees prefer WFH on Friday.
5. Most of the employees are present on Monday.
